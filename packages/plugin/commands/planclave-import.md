## Planclave Review Feedback

!`planclave import $ARGUMENTS`

## Instructions

The review above contains team feedback organized by block line ranges.

Incorporate feedback from open threads into your revised plan.
Resolved threads indicate the reviewer is satisfied — keep the current
approach by default, but adjust at your discretion. Consider reviewer
completion status as well.

Write a revised plan reflecting the feedback, then request approval.
